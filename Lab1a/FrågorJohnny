1. Måste "handshake":et vara för hand steg för steg eller räcker utskrifter
2. Redovisningsplan
3. Måste 2a lämnas in för? Inte redovisas


A FAIRLY SOLID NETWORK APPLICATION

* A NODE SHOULD NOT CRASH IN RESPONSE TO ERRORNOUS INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER NODES
    - SEND ERROR PDU

* NO CRASH AND NO FREEZE ALLOWED, ACT ON OTHER NODE BREAK-DOWN
    - TIMEOUT

* THREADS: ALL SHARED (MUTUAL) DATA MUST BE ACCESSED USING MUTUAL EXCLUSION

* NO DEADLOCKS SHOULD OCCUR (NOT THIS COURSE - THIS COURSE -> OSTRICH)

* IF NODE IS FORCIBLY TERMINATED, ALL THE OTHER NODES MUST UNDERsTAND THIS (TIMEOUTS)

* DEREGISTRATION (CLIENTS) - NODE THAT DISONNECTS NEEDS TO NOTIFY OTHERS

* NOTIFICATION (CLIENTS) - CLIENT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO READ NOTIFICATIONS FROM OTHER CLIENTS

* CLIENT LIST (SERVER) - SERVER NEEDS TO MAINTAIN A LIST OF CLIENTS AND HANDLE DEREGISTRATION


LAB 1B - CHAT SERVER

* CLIENT CONNECT - WELCOME MESSAGE

* THREADS, WHEN CLIENT SENDS MESSAGE, SERVER SENDS NAME AND MESSAGE TO ALL.

* ASYNCRONOUS, CLIENT CAN RECEIVE MESSEGE AT ANY TIME

* SERVER SUPPORT CLIENTS COMMANDS: /QUIT, /WHO, /NICK, /HELP

* SERVER HANDLE EACH CLIENT IN OWN THREAD

* CLIENT HANDLERS EXITS ON IOEXCEPTION, RUN METHOD EXITS AND STREMS AND SOKCKETS CLOSE

* SYNCRONIZED WHEN THEADS DEALING WITH DATA ACCESSED BY MANY THREADS

* WHERE TO HANDLE EXCEPTIONS? THROW UP?
